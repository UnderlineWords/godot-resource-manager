## My Godot Addons
Simple yet effective addons crafted for my open-world sandbox RPG. These addons were developed entirely for my personal project and may not be suitable for general use. However, anyone is free to modify the repository as they wish and use it in their own projects.

I'm still learning Godot and GDScript, so there might be some bugs or incomplete features.
